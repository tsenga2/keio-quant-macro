# Keio Quantitative Macroeconomics

## Spring 2025

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Keio Quantitative Macroeconomics. This course explores quantitative approaches to understanding macroeconomic phenomena, with a focus on computational methods and empirical analysis.

## Course Overview

This course introduces students to quantitative methods in macroeconomics, combining theoretical foundations with practical computational skills. Students will learn to analyze economic data, build and simulate models, and evaluate macroeconomic policies.
